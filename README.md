# Cheat-Organizer
This is a program for cheat codes management. it <b>will</b> be able to move a cheat from a folder to another(wich will deactivate or activate the cheat before you start the game).
Why would you use this? only if you are bored with OPL manager UI, wich is not a real problem.
I only wrote this to learn js and another things.

# Usage
All you have to do to make this program work is point the OPL path, it will detect isos game and cheats.
To create the cheats you can use omniconverter or acess http://gamehacking.org/ to obtain the cheats.
